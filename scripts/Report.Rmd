```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

We should start thinking about how we should organize the report... I included some headings that might work

Goals for the report:
  +Create an econometric model to estimate resources needed to meet biodiversity targets
  +Explain the model in a way that most people can understand
  +Less than 14 pages, but as much appendix as we need
  
##Resources needed

### Waldron

### Rishman (and us)

### TNC

## Costs and benefits of implementing the new Framework

## Discussion


#Appendix
